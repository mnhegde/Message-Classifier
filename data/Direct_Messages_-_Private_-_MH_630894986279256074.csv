"624716755973177373","MH#2175","20-Dec-19 09:35 PM","The equivalent of Christmas Holiday in India is called “Christmas”. Yes, thats right. Much to the surprise and dismay of the western world, India is far more diverse and the beauty of its diversity is that all Indians embrace each others’ cultures and practices. Hindus celebrate Christmas, Muslims play Holi, Christians organize and celebrate Diwali functions, much unlike “OMG!! I am offended by you wearing your cross” in the west.

So yeah, the Indian equivalent of Christmas is called Christmas. It indeed is a matter of interesting coincidence that it is also spelled the same way as Christmas is spelled in the west and amazingly, it falls on the same days of the year as well.","",""

Ok Reddit, so I (237,624 M) and my wife (6 F) got into a bit of an argument about Fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017). She (6F) wanted to play fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017) even though she (6 F) has a PS4 (released 2013), which I (237,624 M) destroyed. I (237,624 M) said no. She (6 F) hit me. So naturally, I grabbed my Unholy Hellbringer (crafted 200,000 years ago in Neptune’s core by demons), and killed her. I also killed our 32 of our boys, being Liam  (2 M), Noah (2 M), Elijah (2 M), Logan (2 M), Mason (2 M), James (2 M), Aiden (2 M), Ethan (2 M), Lucas (2 M), Jacob (2 M), Michael (2 M), Matthew (2 M), Benjamin (2 M), Alexander (2 M), William (2 M), Daniel (2 M), Jayden (2 M), Oliver (2 M), Carter (2 M), Sebastian (2 M), Joseph (2 M), David (2 M), Gabriel (2 M), Julian (2 M), Jackson (2 M), Anthony (2 M), Dylan (2 M), Wyatt (2 M), Grayson (2 M), Isaiah (2 M), Christopher (2 M), and Joshua (2 M). I saved Henry (2 M), because he (2 M) was my favorite child. I thought that he could be raised by wolves while i (237,624 M) played Fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) inside my house. While outside, I (237,624 M) dropped him (2 M) on the pavement and he (2 M) died. So Reddit, AITA I the asshole for killing my whole family?","",""

Note: The general formula for this is $a+b-\gcd(a,b)$, because it is the number of vertical/horizontal lines crossed minus the number of corners crossed (to avoid double counting). In this particular problem, it was $16 + 9 - 1$ (since $\text{gcd}(16,9) = 1$), which is $24$, but then you add $2$ because the first tile and the last tile are counted, which in the general formula are not counted.","",""
